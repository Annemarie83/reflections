What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A repository will be created and from then changes in the files will be tracked

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The repository includes them all (all the files) In the staging area, you select the files that you're going to commit.
