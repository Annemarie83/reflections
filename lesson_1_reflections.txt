How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It showed what parts where modified, so I had just a few lines to manually scan for typo's.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Your log will be much cleaner and it will be easier to look back what has changed. Moreover, Google Doc can save the file in the middle of a sentence which means that versions will be imcomplete.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In Git, multiple files are usually part of a bigger project. They are not a project themselves.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

$ git log --> then you'll see the latest modifications and its correspondentory ID's.
$ git diff ID_OLD ID_NEW --> and you'll see the changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Version control enables you to pinpoint the commit that contains the bug

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
