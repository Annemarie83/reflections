When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am working together with other people. Or when I work from different computers. Keeping my work in a remote repository enables me to acces the repository from different computers and allows others to contribute.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe the changes are not competely done yet, and you get a half finished file or something? I'm not sure....
